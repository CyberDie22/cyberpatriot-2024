### Description

This policy setting pertains to the management of the "Download History" feature in Firefox browsers. The recommended configuration is to set this option to 'Disabled', which prevents the automatic deletion of download history when the browser is closed. This is not a vulnerability per se, but a security best practice aimed at preserving potentially critical data for forensic analysis and auditing purposes.

Key points:
- Setting: Download History
- Recommended State: Disabled
- Purpose: Preserve browsing data, particularly download history
- Rationale: Important for computer investigations and forensic analysis

### Audit

To verify the correct implementation of this policy setting:

1. Navigate to the following registry location:
   ```
   HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Mozilla\Firefox\SanitizeOnShutdown:Downloads
   ```

2. Confirm that the REG_DWORD value is set to 0.

Alternatively, you can check the Group Policy settings:

1. Open the Group Policy Management Console
2. Navigate to the following UI path:
   ```
   Computer Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\Mozilla\Firefox\Clear data when browser is closed\Download History
   ```
3. Verify that the setting is configured as 'Disabled'

### Remediation

To implement the recommended configuration:

1. Open the Group Policy Management Console
2. Navigate to the following UI path:
   ```
   Computer Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\Mozilla\Firefox\Clear data when browser is closed\Download History
   ```
3. Set the policy to 'Disabled'

This configuration will set the following registry value:
```
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Mozilla\Firefox\SanitizeOnShutdown:Downloads = 0
```

Implementing this setting will ensure that download history is preserved when the browser is closed, maintaining potentially valuable data for auditing and forensic purposes.
