# (L1) Ensure 'browser.safebrowsing.malware.enabled' is set to 'Enabled'

## Description

This vulnerability relates to a critical security configuration in Mozilla Firefox. The `browser.safebrowsing.malware.enabled` preference controls Firefox's built-in safe browsing feature, which warns users about known malicious websites. When this setting is disabled, it significantly reduces Firefox's ability to protect users from potentially harmful content.

**Impact:**
Users browsing with this setting disabled are at increased risk of unknowingly visiting malicious websites, potentially exposing them to various web-based threats.

**Root Cause:**
This is not a vulnerability in Firefox itself, but rather a security misconfiguration. The issue arises when the policy to enable this critical security feature is not properly enforced across the intended group of users or systems.

**Severity:**
While not a traditional vulnerability, this misconfiguration represents a significant security risk. The severity is mitigated by the fact that it's a configuration issue rather than a direct exploit, but it should be addressed promptly to ensure proper protection for users.

## Audit

To verify the current configuration:

### Windows:

1. Open the Registry Editor.
2. Navigate to the following key:
   ```
   HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Mozilla\Firefox\Preferences
   ```
3. Check for the presence of `browser.safebrowsing.malware.enabled`.
4. Verify that its value is set to `1` (REG_DWORD).

### Linux:

1. Locate the Firefox configuration file. This is typically found in one of these locations:
   - `/etc/firefox/policies/policies.json`
   - `/usr/lib/firefox/distribution/policies.json`
2. Check for the following configuration:
   ```json
   {
     "policies": {
       "Preferences": {
         "browser.safebrowsing.malware.enabled": true
       }
     }
   }
   ```

## Remediation

To implement the recommended configuration:

### Windows:

1. Download and install the necessary ADMX/ADML files from [Mozilla's policy templates repository](https://github.com/mozilla/policy-templates/releases).
2. Open the Group Policy Management Console.
3. Navigate to the following path:
   ```
   Computer Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\Mozilla\Firefox\Preferences (Deprecated)
   ```
4. Locate and double-click on `browser.safebrowsing.malware.enabled`.
5. Set it to `Enabled`.
6. Click `Apply` and then `OK`.
7. Run `gpupdate /force` on affected systems to apply the changes.

### Linux:

1. Create or edit the Firefox policy file (typically `/etc/firefox/policies/policies.json` or `/usr/lib/firefox/distribution/policies.json`).
2. Ensure the file contains the following configuration:
   ```json
   {
     "policies": {
       "Preferences": {
         "browser.safebrowsing.malware.enabled": true
       }
     }
   }
   ```
3. Save the file and restart Firefox on affected systems.

Note: In both Windows and Linux environments, ensure that users do not have the ability to override this setting. Regular audits should be performed to verify continued compliance.
