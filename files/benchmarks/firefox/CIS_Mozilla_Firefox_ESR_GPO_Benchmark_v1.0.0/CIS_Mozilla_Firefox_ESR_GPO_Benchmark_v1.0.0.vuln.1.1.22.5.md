### Description

This vulnerability concerns the absence of enforced Enhanced Tracking Protection (ETP) in Mozilla Firefox. The recommended setting for "Fingerprinting" under ETP is "Enabled," but by default, this policy is set to "Disabled." When left unconfigured, this leaves users exposed to third-party tracking, potentially compromising their privacy and facilitating the collection of sensitive information for malicious purposes.

The vulnerability stems from:

1. The lack of a properly configured Group Policy Object (GPO)
2. The absence of the corresponding registry setting

Without these elements in place, Firefox's Enhanced Tracking Protection cannot function as intended, leaving users vulnerable to tracking by third parties.

### Audit

To audit this setting:

1. For Windows:
   - Open the Group Policy Management Console
   - Navigate to: Computer Configuration > Policies > Administrative Templates > Mozilla > Firefox > Tracking Protection > Fingerprinting
   - Verify that the setting is set to "Enabled"

   Alternatively, check the registry:
   - Open the Registry Editor
   - Navigate to: HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Mozilla\Firefox\EnableTrackingProtection
   - Verify that the "Fingerprinting" value is set to 1 (REG_DWORD)

2. For Linux:
   - Firefox policies on Linux are typically managed through a JSON configuration file.
   - Check for the existence and content of the file: /etc/firefox/policies/policies.json
   - Verify that it contains the following configuration:
     ```json
     {
       "policies": {
         "EnableTrackingProtection": {
           "Fingerprinting": true
         }
       }
     }
     ```

### Remediation

To remediate this vulnerability:

1. For Windows:
   - Ensure the necessary .admx/.adml files are deployed in your environment
   - Open the Group Policy Management Console
   - Navigate to: Computer Configuration > Policies > Administrative Templates > Mozilla > Firefox > Tracking Protection > Fingerprinting
   - Set the policy to "Enabled"
   - Run 'gpupdate /force' on affected systems to apply the changes

2. For Linux:
   - Create or edit the file: /etc/firefox/policies/policies.json
   - Add the following content:
     ```json
     {
       "policies": {
         "EnableTrackingProtection": {
           "Fingerprinting": true
         }
       }
     }
     ```
   - Ensure the file has appropriate permissions (e.g., readable by all users)
   - Restart Firefox on affected systems for the changes to take effect

After implementing these changes, Firefox's Enhanced Tracking Protection will be enabled, helping to protect users from third-party tracking and potential privacy breaches.
