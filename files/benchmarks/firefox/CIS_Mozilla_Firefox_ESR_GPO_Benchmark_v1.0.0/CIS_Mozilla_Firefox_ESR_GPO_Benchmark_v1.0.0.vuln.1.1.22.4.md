## Description

This policy setting configures the "Do Not Track" (DNT) feature in Mozilla Firefox. When enabled, the browser sends an optional HTTP header in requests indicating a preference not to be tracked by websites. The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

It's important to note that this is not a traditional vulnerability, but rather a privacy-enhancing configuration. Key points include:

1. The DNT header is voluntary and not universally respected by websites.
2. Many websites do honor the request, providing some privacy benefits.
3. This setting does not address a security flaw in the browser itself.
4. Enabling this option is a privacy best practice, not a security fix.

## Audit

To audit this setting:

1. Open the Group Policy Management Console
2. Navigate to: Computer Configuration > Policies > Administrative Templates > Mozilla > Firefox > Tracking Protection
3. Verify that the "Enabled" setting is set to "Enabled"

Alternatively, you can check the registry:

1. Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe)
2. Navigate to: HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Mozilla\Firefox
3. Verify that the "EnableTrackingProtection" value exists and is set to 1 (DWORD)

## Remediation

### Windows:

1. Open the Group Policy Management Console
2. Navigate to: Computer Configuration > Policies > Administrative Templates > Mozilla > Firefox > Tracking Protection
3. Double-click on the "Enabled" setting
4. Select "Enabled"
5. Click "Apply" and then "OK"

Note: If the policy path doesn't exist, you'll need to download and install the Firefox Group Policy template (firefox.admx/adml) from: https://github.com/mozilla/policy-templates/releases

### Linux:

For Linux systems, Firefox typically uses a configuration file instead of the Windows registry. To enable DNT:

1. Locate the Firefox configuration file, usually in `/etc/firefox/policies/policies.json`
2. If the file doesn't exist, create it
3. Add or modify the following JSON content:

```json
{
  "policies": {
    "EnableTrackingProtection": {
      "Value": true
    }
  }
}
```

4. Save the file and restart Firefox

For both Windows and Linux, ensure that changes are applied consistently across all managed systems in your environment.
