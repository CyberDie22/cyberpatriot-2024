# (L1) Ensure 'Disable Private Browsing' is set to 'Enabled'

## Description

This vulnerability pertains to the configuration of Firefox's private browsing mode in a corporate environment managed via Group Policy. The issue arises when users are allowed to use private browsing, potentially bypassing corporate security measures and hindering forensic analysis.

Private browsing mode, when enabled, prevents the local storage of user browsing data such as history and cookies. This can compromise security incident response and make it difficult to investigate potentially malicious activity. The vulnerability is not a software flaw in Firefox itself, but rather an incorrect configuration of a policy designed to monitor user activity.

The impact of this misconfiguration includes:

- Lack of comprehensive log data for forensic investigations
- Reduced accountability
- Potential for covert malicious activity
- Challenges in identifying security breaches and enforcing policies

## Audit

To verify the correct configuration:

1. Open the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC)
2. Navigate to the following path:
   ```
   Computer Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\Mozilla\Firefox
   ```
3. Locate the "Disable Private Browsing" setting
4. Confirm that it is set to "Enabled"

Alternatively, you can check the registry:

1. Open the Registry Editor
2. Navigate to:
   ```
   HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Mozilla\Firefox
   ```
3. Verify that the "DisablePrivateBrowsing" value exists and is set to 1 (REG_DWORD)

## Remediation

### Windows

1. Download the Firefox ADMX/ADML files from: https://github.com/mozilla/policy-templates/releases
2. Copy the downloaded files to your Policy Definitions folder (usually `%SystemRoot%\PolicyDefinitions`)
3. Open the Group Policy Management Console
4. Navigate to the following path:
   ```
   Computer Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\Mozilla\Firefox
   ```
5. Locate and double-click on "Disable Private Browsing"
6. Set the policy to "Enabled"
7. Click "Apply" and then "OK"
8. Run `gpupdate /force` on target machines to apply the new policy

### Linux

For Linux environments using Firefox, the process is different as Group Policy is not typically used:

1. Locate the Firefox configuration file, usually in `/etc/firefox/policies/policies.json`
2. If the file doesn't exist, create it with the following content:
   ```json
   {
     "policies": {
       "DisablePrivateBrowsing": true
     }
   }
   ```
3. If the file already exists, add the "DisablePrivateBrowsing" policy to the existing policies
4. Save the file and restart Firefox for the changes to take effect

Note: Ensure that the configuration file has the correct permissions and ownership for the Firefox process to read it.
