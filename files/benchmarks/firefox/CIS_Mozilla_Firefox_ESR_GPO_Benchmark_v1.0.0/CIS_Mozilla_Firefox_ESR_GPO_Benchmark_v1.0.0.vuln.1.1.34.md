## Description

The policy "Ensure 'Disable System Addon Updates' is set to 'Disabled'" addresses the vulnerability of outdated third-party Firefox Add-ons. This setting configures Firefox to automatically download and install updates for Add-ons, mitigating the risk of potential security exploits in outdated add-ons.

Key vulnerability aspects:

1. Unpatched vulnerabilities in system add-ons could be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access or compromise user data.
2. Both zero-day and known vulnerabilities in add-ons are targeted by this policy.
3. Potential impacts include data breaches, system compromise, and malware infections.

The policy aims to keep add-ons current, protecting users from identified weaknesses and potential future vulnerabilities.

## Audit

To audit this setting:

### Windows:
1. Open the Group Policy Management Console (gpmc.msc).
2. Navigate to the following UI path:
   ```
   Computer Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\Mozilla\Firefox\Disable System Addon Updates
   ```
3. Verify that the setting is set to "Disabled".

4. Additionally, check the registry:
   - Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe)
   - Navigate to:
     ```
     HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Mozilla\Firefox
     ```
   - Confirm that the "DisableSystemAddonUpdate" value is set to 0 (REG_DWORD).

### Linux:
1. Locate the Firefox configuration file. This is typically found in:
   ```
   /etc/firefox/policies/policies.json
   ```
2. Check for the following entry:
   ```json
   {
     "policies": {
       "DisableSystemAddonUpdate": false
     }
   }
   ```
3. Ensure that "DisableSystemAddonUpdate" is set to false.

## Remediation

To remediate this setting:

### Windows:
1. Open the Group Policy Management Console (gpmc.msc).
2. Navigate to the following UI path:
   ```
   Computer Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\Mozilla\Firefox\Disable System Addon Updates
   ```
3. Set the policy to "Disabled".
4. Run `gpupdate /force` from the command line to apply the changes.

### Linux:
1. Locate or create the Firefox configuration file:
   ```
   /etc/firefox/policies/policies.json
   ```
2. Ensure the file contains the following content:
   ```json
   {
     "policies": {
       "DisableSystemAddonUpdate": false
     }
   }
   ```
3. Save the file and restart Firefox for the changes to take effect.

For both operating systems, ensure that Firefox has the necessary permissions to download and install updates for add-ons.
