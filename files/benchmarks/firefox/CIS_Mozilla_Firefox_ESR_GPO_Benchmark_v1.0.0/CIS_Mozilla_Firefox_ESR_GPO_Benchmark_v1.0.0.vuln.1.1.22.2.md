# (L1) Ensure 'Do not allow tracking protection preferences to be changed' is set to 'Enabled'

## Description

This policy setting determines if tracking protection preferences can be changed by the user in Mozilla Firefox. The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled. 

When enabled, this policy prevents users from modifying their tracking protection settings within Firefox. This is enforced through a Group Policy Object (GPO) that blocks changes to the tracking protection settings, effectively preventing users from customizing their privacy controls.

**Impact:**
* Reduced user privacy and control: Users are unable to adjust their tracking protection levels to suit their individual needs.
* Potential for unintended consequences: Users might be unknowingly exposed to increased tracking or unwanted data collection if the default tracking protection isn't sufficient or appropriate for them.

**Technical Details:**
* Mechanism: Group Policy is used to disable the user interface elements for changing tracking protection settings.
* A registry key (`HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Mozilla\Firefox\EnableTrackingProtection:Locked`) is set to 1 to enforce the policy.
* Prerequisites: The appropriate Firefox policy template (`.admx` and `.adml`) file must be deployed to the domain controller(s) for the GPO to be effective.

## Audit

To audit this setting:

1. Open the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) on a domain controller or a system with the Group Policy Management tools installed.

2. Navigate to the following UI path:
   ```
   Computer Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\Mozilla\Firefox\Tracking Protection\Do not allow tracking protection preferences to be changed
   ```

3. Verify that the setting is set to "Enabled".

Alternatively, you can check the registry:

1. Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe) with administrative privileges.

2. Navigate to the following registry key:
   ```
   HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Mozilla\Firefox\EnableTrackingProtection:Locked
   ```

3. Verify that the value is set to 1 (REG_DWORD).

## Remediation

### Windows:

To establish the recommended configuration via Group Policy:

1. Ensure you have the Firefox Group Policy template (firefox.admx/adml) installed. If not, download and install it from the official Mozilla website.

2. Open the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC).

3. Navigate to the following UI path:
   ```
   Computer Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\Mozilla\Firefox\Tracking Protection\Do not allow tracking protection preferences to be changed
   ```

4. Set the policy to "Enabled".

5. Apply the Group Policy changes and force a Group Policy update on target systems.

### Linux:

Firefox on Linux typically doesn't use Group Policy. However, you can achieve similar results using a policy file:

1. Create or edit the file `/etc/firefox/policies/policies.json`

2. Add or modify the following content:
   ```json
   {
     "policies": {
       "DisableTrackingProtectionPreferences": true
     }
   }
   ```

3. Save the file and restart Firefox for the changes to take effect.
