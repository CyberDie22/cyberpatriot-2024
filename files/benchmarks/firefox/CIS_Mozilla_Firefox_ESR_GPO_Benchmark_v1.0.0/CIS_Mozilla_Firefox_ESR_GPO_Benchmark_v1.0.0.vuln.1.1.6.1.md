# (L1) Ensure 'Cookie Behavior' is set to 'Enabled: Reject cookies for known trackers and partition third-party cookies'

## Description

This policy setting configures the ability for third-party cookies to be downloaded to the system. Third-party cookies are cookies sent by a domain that differs from the domain in the browser's address bar. The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Reject cookies for known trackers and partition third-party cookies.

Third-party cookies are often used for tracking user browsing behaviors, which has privacy implications. By enabling this setting, you enhance user privacy by limiting the tracking of browsing activity by various entities. However, it's important to note that this may impact the functionality of some websites that rely on third-party cookies for features such as advertising, analytics, or login services.

## Audit

To audit this setting:

### Windows:

1. Open the Group Policy Management Console (gpmc.msc).
2. Navigate to the following UI path:
   ```
   Computer Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\Mozilla\Firefox\Cookies\Cookie Behavior
   ```
3. Verify that the setting is configured as "Enabled: Reject cookies for known trackers and partition third-party cookies".

Alternatively, you can check the registry:

1. Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
2. Navigate to the following key:
   ```
   HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Mozilla\Firefox\Cookies
   ```
3. Verify that the "Behavior" value is set to "reject-tracker-and-partition-foreign".

### Linux:

Firefox on Linux typically doesn't use Group Policy. Instead, you'll need to check the user's `prefs.js` file or the `policies.json` file if using the Enterprise Policy Engine.

1. Look for the `prefs.js` file in the user's Firefox profile directory.
2. Check for a line similar to:
   ```
   user_pref("network.cookie.cookieBehavior", 5);
   ```
   Where 5 corresponds to "Reject cookies for known trackers and partition third-party cookies".

## Remediation

To implement the recommended configuration:

### Windows:

1. Download and install the Firefox Group Policy template (firefox.admx/adml) if not already present.
2. Open the Group Policy Management Console (gpmc.msc).
3. Navigate to the following UI path:
   ```
   Computer Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\Mozilla\Firefox\Cookies\Cookie Behavior
   ```
4. Set the policy to "Enabled: Reject cookies for known trackers and partition third-party cookies".

### Linux:

For Linux systems using the Enterprise Policy Engine:

1. Create or edit the `policies.json` file in the Firefox installation directory (typically `/etc/firefox/policies/`).
2. Add the following configuration:
   ```json
   {
     "policies": {
       "Cookies": {
         "Behavior": "reject_tracker_and_partition_third_party"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

For individual user profiles:

1. Open Firefox and navigate to `about:config`.
2. Search for `network.cookie.cookieBehavior`.
3. Set its value to `5`.

Note: Ensure that users are aware of this change, as it may affect the functionality of some websites they use.
