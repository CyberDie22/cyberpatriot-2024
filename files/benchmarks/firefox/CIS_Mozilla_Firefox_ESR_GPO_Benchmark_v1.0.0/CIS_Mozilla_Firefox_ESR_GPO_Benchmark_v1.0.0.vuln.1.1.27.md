# (L1) Ensure 'Disable Feedback Commands' is set to 'Enabled'

## Description

This policy setting configures accessibility to the Submit Feedback and Report Deceptive Site menu items in the help menu of Mozilla Firefox. The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

The vulnerability arises when this Group Policy setting is left in its default (disabled) state, allowing users to report issues and potentially send sensitive information to third-party vendors. This can lead to:

1. Reduced user reporting of security threats within the organization's network
2. Limited feedback on usability or malfunction through approved channels
3. Increased risk of undetected compromise due to lack of proper reporting mechanisms

The severity of this vulnerability depends on the environment:

- **Low:** In environments with alternative reporting mechanisms and minimal impact from external reporting
- **Medium/High:** In environments prioritizing security awareness and managing sensitive data

## Audit

To audit this setting:

1. Open the Group Policy Management Console
2. Navigate to: Computer Configuration > Policies > Administrative Templates > Mozilla > Firefox
3. Locate the "Disable Feedback Commands" policy
4. Verify that it is set to "Enabled"

Alternatively, you can check the registry:

```
Key: HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Mozilla\Firefox
Value: DisableFeedbackCommands
Type: REG_DWORD
Data: 1 (Enabled)
```

## Remediation

### Windows:

1. Download and install the required Firefox ADMX template from the official Mozilla website
2. Open the Group Policy Management Console
3. Navigate to: Computer Configuration > Policies > Administrative Templates > Mozilla > Firefox
4. Locate and open the "Disable Feedback Commands" policy
5. Set it to "Enabled"
6. Click "Apply" and then "OK"
7. Run `gpupdate /force` from an elevated command prompt to apply the changes

### Linux:

For Linux systems, Firefox policies are typically managed through a JSON configuration file. Follow these steps:

1. Create or edit the file `/etc/firefox/policies/policies.json`
2. Add or modify the following content:

```json
{
  "policies": {
    "DisableFeedbackCommands": true
  }
}
```

3. Save the file and ensure it has the correct permissions (readable by the Firefox process)
4. Restart Firefox for the changes to take effect

Note: The exact location of the policies file may vary depending on your Linux distribution and Firefox installation method.
