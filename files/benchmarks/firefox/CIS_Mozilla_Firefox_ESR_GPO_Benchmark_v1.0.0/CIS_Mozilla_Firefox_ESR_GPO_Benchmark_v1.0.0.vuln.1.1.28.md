# (L1) Ensure 'Disable Firefox Accounts' is set to 'Enabled'

## Description

This policy setting controls whether a user can sign into Firefox with an account to use services. The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

The vulnerability stems from the default configuration of the "Disable Firefox Accounts" Group Policy, which is set to "Disabled". This allows users to sign in with their Firefox accounts, potentially importing and syncing data from personal accounts into the corporate network. This could lead to:

1. Sensitive information (passwords, financial data, etc.) being stored on the corporate network
2. Loss of control over browser data used for sensitive tasks
3. Potential data exfiltration risks
4. Breaches of data privacy and security standards

Syncing user data, especially from a personal account, can contain information that is not appropriate for an enterprise environment. While the standard Firefox configuration doesn't inherently leave a vulnerability, the environment is particularly susceptible to synchronization issues if this intended safeguard is not enforced.

## Audit

To audit this setting:

1. Open the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC)
2. Navigate to the following UI path:
   ```
   Computer Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\Mozilla\Firefox\Disable Firefox Accounts
   ```
3. Verify that the setting is set to "Enabled"

Alternatively, you can check the registry:

1. Open the Registry Editor
2. Navigate to the following key:
   ```
   HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Mozilla\Firefox
   ```
3. Verify that the "DisableFirefoxAccounts" value exists and is set to 1 (REG_DWORD)

Note: The Group Policy path may not exist by default. Ensure that the additional Group Policy template (firefox.admx/adml) has been installed.

## Remediation

### Windows:

To establish the recommended configuration via Group Policy:

1. Download and install the additional Group Policy template (firefox.admx/adml) if not already present
2. Open the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC)
3. Navigate to the following UI path:
   ```
   Computer Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\Mozilla\Firefox\Disable Firefox Accounts
   ```
4. Set the policy to "Enabled"
5. Apply the changes and update Group Policy on all affected systems

### Linux:

Firefox on Linux systems typically doesn't use Group Policy. However, you can achieve similar results by modifying the Firefox configuration file:

1. Locate the Firefox installation directory (usually `/usr/lib/firefox` or `/usr/lib64/firefox`)
2. Create or edit the `distribution/policies.json` file
3. Add or modify the following content:
   ```json
   {
     "policies": {
       "DisableFirefoxAccounts": true
     }
   }
   ```
4. Save the file and restart Firefox

For both Windows and Linux environments, it's crucial to implement a comprehensive data governance and user access control policy to mitigate potential risks associated with unauthorized access to data synced through Firefox accounts. Regular security audits should be performed to verify that these controls are consistently implemented.
